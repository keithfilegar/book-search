## Google Book Search App
This is a project built using React.js to utilize the Google Book API https://developers.google.com/books.
Users are able to search a keyword to find a list of books and filter based on the print type and type of book they are looking for.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
